# python-coding-challenges
This repo is a collection of the Python problem sets I worked on during [UChicago's class CAPP121](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/index.html).

[Modeling Epidemics](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa1/index.html) - basics of Python, translate simple algorithms into code

[Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html) - nested loops, lists of lists, and functions

[Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html) - dictionaries as a way to represent data

[Polling places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html) - designing and implementing classes and methods

[Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html) - NumPy, classes, and functions to support code reuse

[Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa6/index.html) - recursive data structures and functions

The URLs redirect to each one of the projects' web pages. Due to the program's policies, I cannot post code solutions publicly. However, these could be shared by reaching me via email: harshpachisia@uchicago.edu
